# How does the internet work

The internet is a wire that allows computers to communicate with each other.

A **server** will store all sorts of data: websites, email accounts, etc.

Servers are directly connected to the internet, while **clients** aren't, they need an internal server provider to access it. A client would be your personnal computer, you smartphone, your gps, ...

Not only do we have servers and clients, there is also **rooters**: these are devices that send information from the internet to personal devices. They ensure the data transmission.

## In summary

_Thanks to the internet you will be able to access all sorts of data stored all arround the world, your computer will communicate with the correct server (through the rooters) to find and retrieve the data you want/need._
